# UiPath RPA User Acceptance Testing Project

## Overview
This project focuses on automating the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) process for a web application using UiPath Robotic Process Automation (RPA). The goal is to optimize the testing process, minimize manual tasks, and ensure the web application functions as expected.

## Prerequisites
- A UiPath Automation Cloud account
- UiPath Studio Community Edition installed
- Access to the web application (URL provided)
- Credentials: Username – , Password – 

## Project Structure
- GitHub Repository: Link provided to the repository
- UiPath Process: "Connected Office Web Application – User Acceptance Testing"

## How to Use UiPath RPA for UAT:
1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Install UiPath Studio Community Edition (if not already installed).
3. Open the 'Connected Office Web Application – User Acceptance Testing' process.
4. Prepare an Excel file with input data and expected results.
5. Run the UiPath process to automate the UAT tasks.

## Recording Results
After execution, the results are recorded in the data table, showing whether test cases passed or failed. The 'Test Results' column in the Excel sheet will display TRUE for pass and FALSE for fail.

# Project Documentation

## Accessing the Report
- Navigate to the 'Reports' folder in the GitHub repository.
- Locate the file named 'UAT_Report_MMDDYYYY.pdf' (replace MMDDYYYY with the report generation date).

## Opening the Report
- Download the PDF file.
- Use a PDF reader to view the report.

## Navigating the Report
- The report includes sections for easy navigation.
- Use the table of contents to access specific sections.

## Understanding the Report
The report provides:
1. Summary: Overview of the testing process and results.
2. Test Cases: Details of each test case, including input, expected, and actual results.
3. Pass/Fail Status: Indicates which test cases passed or failed.
4. Test Results: Logs and screenshots of failed test cases.
5. Recommendations: Suggested actions based on the results.

## Using Test Results
- Review the Pass/Fail section to identify failed test cases.
- For failed cases, check the 'Test Results' section for issues.
- Follow the 'Recommendations' to resolve any failures.

## Reporting Issues
If you encounter issues, report them to the project owner (contact details in the README).
